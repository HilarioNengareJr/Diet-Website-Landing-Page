# Diet Website Landing Page

This project is a landing page for a diet website developed using ReactJS and CSS3. It showcases various features of React such as component-based architecture, state management using hooks, and CSS styling for creating an engaging user interface.

## Features

- **React Components**: The landing page is divided into reusable components such as Header, Hero Section, Footer, etc., making the code modular and maintainable.

- **State Management with Hooks**: React state hooks (useState, useEffect) are utilized to manage the dynamic content and interactive elements on the page. For example, the Testimonials section may fetch data asynchronously and update the UI accordingly.

- **CSS3 Styling**: Custom CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the landing page. This includes animations, transitions, responsive layouts, and other CSS3 features to create a modern and attractive design.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a declarative and efficient way to create UI components.

- **CSS3**: Cascading Style Sheets version 3 is used for styling the components, including animations, transitions, and responsive layouts.
